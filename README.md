Dear reader,                                                                                    30/09/2019

For this portfolio-repository I will upload all my miniprojects for the sake of training for programming. My codes are free of use. Most likely my code will be a synergetic result from looking at codes others has uploaded on the web and my own thinking, so I will try my best to give credit where it is most appropriate. 

Regards,
Peder Wessel
